## 🎯 Key Findings: Why Apertus Chooses "Unexpected" Words

### 📊 Sampling Parameters Revealed

```
🎛️ Default Settings:
   Temperature: 0.7 (creativity control)
   Top-P: 0.9 (nucleus sampling - 90% probability mass)
   Top-K: 50 (candidate pool size)
```

### 🎲 Real Decision Process: "Die Schweizer KI-Forschung ist"

#### **Step 1: "international" (rank 2 selected, not rank 1)**

```
🌡️ Temperature Effect:
   Without temp: Top-1 = 7.4%  (fairly distributed)
   With temp=0.7: Top-1 = 15.0% (more decisive)

🎯 Top Predictions:
   1. ' in' → 15.0% (logit: +19.25) ✅ 
   2. ' international' → 9.1% (logit: +18.88) ✅ ← SELECTED!
   3. ' im' → 6.3% (logit: +18.62)
   4. ' stark' → 4.9% (logit: +18.50)  
   5. ' gut' → 4.9% (logit: +18.50)

🔄 Filtering Process:
   • Top-K: 131,072 → 50 candidates (99.96% reduction)
   • Top-P: 50 → 27 tokens (kept 91.4% probability mass)
   • Final sampling: ' international' had 10.9% chance

🎲 WHY RANK 2? 
   Temperature + Top-P sampling allows creative choices!
   Model didn't just pick "in" (boring) but chose "international" (more interesting)
```

#### **Step 2: "sehr" (rank 3 selected from very confident predictions)**

```
🌡️ Temperature Effect:  
   Without temp: Top-1 = 27.5% 
   With temp=0.7: Top-1 = 50.4% (much more confident)

🎯 Top Predictions:
   1. ' aner' → 50.4% (anerkannt = recognized) ← Expected top choice
   2. ' gut' → 14.5% (good)
   3. ' sehr' → 6.8% (very) ← SELECTED!
   4. ' hoch' → 6.8% (high)
   5. ' bekannt' → 6.0% (well-known)

🌀 Nucleus Sampling Effect:
   • Only 6 tokens in nucleus (88.7% mass)
   • Very focused distribution  
   • "sehr" still had 7.8% final probability

🎲 WHY RANK 3?
   Even with high confidence, sampling diversity chose "sehr" 
   Creates more natural sentence flow: "international sehr angesehen"
```

## ⚖️ Native Weights Analysis: Layer 15 Attention

### **Query Projection (Q_proj):**
```
📊 Shape: (4096, 4096) - Full attention dimension
📊 Parameters: 16,777,216 (16.8M - 20% of total model!)
📊 Memory: 64.0 MB

📈 Weight Health:
   Mean: -0.000013 (perfectly centered!)
   Std: 0.078517 (healthy spread)
   Range: 2.289 (well-bounded: -1.17 to +1.12)

🕸️ Sparsity (dead weights):
   |w| < 0.0001: 0.1% (almost no dead weights)
   |w| < 0.01: 11.2% (mostly active weights)
   |w| < 0.1: 81.4% (reasonable activation range)

🎯 Weight Distribution:
   50th percentile: 0.049 (median weight)
   99th percentile: 0.221 (strongest weights)
   99.9th percentile: 0.340 (most critical weights)
```

### **Key vs Value Projections:**
```
K_proj: (1024, 4096) - 4x dimensionality reduction
V_proj: (1024, 4096) - Same reduction
   
Key advantages: More compact, efficient
Query maintains: Full 4096 dimensions for rich queries
```

**What this means**: Apertus uses asymmetric attention - rich queries, compressed keys/values for efficiency!

## 🧠 Layer Evolution: From Syntax to Semantics

### **The Neural Journey Through 32 Layers:**

```
Input → Layer 0: L2=4.8 (raw embeddings)
     ↓
Early → Layer 3: L2=18,634 (4000x increase! syntax processing)
     ↓  
Mid   → Layer 15: L2=19,863 (semantic understanding)
     ↓
Late  → Layer 27: L2=32,627 (peak conceptual representation)
     ↓
Output→ Layer 30: L2=25,293 (output preparation, slight compression)
```

### **What Each Stage Does:**

**Layer 0 (Embeddings):**
- 🔤 Raw token → vector conversion
- 📊 Sparsity: 21.6% (many inactive dimensions)
- 🎯 Focus: Technical terms ('-In', 'nov') get initial boost

**Layers 3-9 (Syntax Processing):**
- 🧠 Grammar and structure analysis
- 📈 Massive activation jump (4000x increase!)
- 🎯 Sentence boundaries ('.', '\<s\>') become dominant
- 🔍 **Why**: Model learns punctuation is structurally crucial

**Layers 15-21 (Semantic Processing):**
- 🧠 Meaning emerges beyond grammar
- 📊 Continued growth: 19K → 23K L2 norm
- 🎯 Content concepts: 'Sch' (Swiss), 'nov' (innovation)
- 🔍 **Why**: Model builds conceptual understanding

**Layer 27 (Peak Understanding):**
- 🧠 Full conceptual representation achieved
- 📊 Peak L2: 32,627 (maximum representation strength)
- 🎯 Identity focus: 'we' (Swiss context) highly active
- 🔍 **Why**: Complete semantic integration

**Layer 30 (Output Ready):**
- 🧠 Preparing for text generation
- 📉 Slight compression: 32K → 25K L2
- ⚖️ Mean goes negative: -5.16 (output pattern)
- 🎯 Structural prep: '\<s\>', 'K', '-In' for continuation

## 👁️ Real-Time Attention Patterns

### **Generation: "Apertus ist transparent." → "Im Interesse der"**

```
Step 1: '.' attends to:
   1. '\<s\>' (66.0%) - Strong sentence-level context
   2. 'transparent' (10.5%) - Key concept  
   3. 'ist' (2.8%) - Grammatical anchor
   → Generates: ' Im'

Step 2: 'Im' attends to:  
   1. '\<s\>' (64.1%) - Maintains global context
   2. '.' (4.0%) - Sentence boundary awareness
   3. 'transparent' (2.5%) - Semantic connection
   → Generates: ' Interesse'

Step 3: 'Interesse' attends to:
   1. '\<s\>' (63.3%) - Consistent global focus
   2. 'Im' (3.3%) - Immediate context
   3. '.' (3.0%) - Structural awareness  
   → Generates: ' der'
```

**Attention Insights:**
- 🎯 **Global Context Dominance**: '\<s\>' gets 60-66% attention consistently
- 🔗 **Semantic Connections**: Strong links to key concepts ('transparent')
- 📝 **Structural Awareness**: Punctuation influences generation direction
- 🇩🇪 **German Grammar**: Perfect "Im Interesse der" construction

## 🔤 German Language Excellence: "Bundesgesundheitsamt"

### **Tokenization Comparison:**

| Model | Tokens | Efficiency | Strategy |
|-------|--------|------------|----------|
| **🇨🇭 Apertus** | 6 | **3.3 chars/token** | Morphological awareness |
| 🤖 GPT-2 | 9 | 2.2 chars/token | Character-level splitting |
| 📚 BERT | 7 | 2.9 chars/token | Subword units |

### **Apertus Tokenization:**
```
'Bundesgesundheitsamt' (20 chars) →
['B', 'undes', 'ges', 'und', 'heits', 'amt']

Morphological Analysis:
• 'B' + 'undes' = Bundes (Federal)
• 'ges' + 'und' + 'heits' = gesundheits (health)  
• 'amt' = amt (office)

Vocabulary: 131,072 tokens (2.6x larger than GPT-2)
```

### **German Compound Performance:**
```
Krankenversicherung → 5 tokens (3.8 chars/token) ✅
Rechtsschutzversicherung → 6 tokens (4.0 chars/token) ✅  
Arbeitsplatzcomputer → 5 tokens (4.0 chars/token) ✅
Donaudampfschifffahrt → 9 tokens (2.3 chars/token) ⚠️ (very complex)
```

**Why Apertus Wins at German:**
- ✅ **50% more efficient** than GPT-2 for compound words
- ✅ **Morphological boundaries** - splits at meaningful parts  
- ✅ **Swiss linguistic optimization** - trained on German text
- ✅ **Largest vocabulary** - 131K vs 50K (GPT-2)

## 🎛️ Sampling Strategy Deep Dive

### **Why Models Don't Always Pick Top-1:**

```
🌡️ Temperature = 0.7 Effect:
   Original: [7.4%, 5.1%, 4.0%, 3.5%, 3.5%] (flat distribution)  
   With 0.7:  [15.0%, 9.1%, 6.3%, 4.9%, 4.9%] (more decisive)

🌀 Top-P = 0.9 Effect:
   Keeps tokens until 90% probability mass reached
   Example: 131,072 total → 27 nucleus tokens (massive filtering!)

🔄 Top-K = 50 Effect:
   Only considers 50 most likely tokens
   Eliminates 131,022 impossible choices (99.96% reduction!)
```

### **Real Sampling Decisions:**

**Step 1**: " international" selected from rank 2
- 🎯 Final probability: 10.9% (after filtering)
- 🎲 **Why not rank 1?** Creative diversity over predictability
- 🧠 **Result**: More interesting content than "Die Schweizer KI-Forschung ist in..."

**Step 5**: " ist" selected from rank 9  
- 🎯 Final probability: ~2-3% (low but possible)
- 🎲 **Why rank 9?** High entropy (3.672) = many good options
- 🧠 **Result**: Grammatical continuation (though repetitive)
