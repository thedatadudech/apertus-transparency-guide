# 🇨🇭 Apertus Swiss AI Transparency Dashboard

**The world's first completely transparent language model - now with live interactive analysis!**

## What makes Apertus special?

Unlike ChatGPT, Claude, or other black-box AI systems, **Apertus is completely transparent**:

- 🧠 **See every attention pattern** - which tokens the model focuses on
- ⚖️ **Inspect every weight** - the actual parameters that make decisions  
- 🎲 **View every prediction** - probabilities for every possible next word
- 🔍 **Track every computation** - through all 32 transformer layers
- 🌍 **Multilingual transparency** - works in German, French, Italian, English, Romansh

## Try it yourself!

1. **💬 Chat with Apertus** in any language
2. **🔍 Analyze attention patterns** - see what the model focuses on
3. **📊 Explore model internals** - complete transparency into AI decisions
